Instructions
You are encouraged to source an asset with multiple rooms, at least 5 rooms. This assignment focuses on basic UI design and camera navigation.

Your project must include:

A start/welcome screen with a welcome message or project title and appropriate buttons for different pages(introduction, instruction, settings page, user profile, credit, etc).
A start button to enter the main environment and a quit button to close the game.
There should be at least 3 UI pages the user can go back and forth
The start button should start the experience and disable the entire welcome screen, revealing the environment scene(it is up to you to decide whether you want a different scene for the menu or keep the menu and game scene in a single file.
Tell a story that takes the user/player to the different rooms in the building. This can be done with buttons and UI texts since we haven't learned about audio implementation.
This can be as simple as starting the story in one room and the player can click a button to go to the next room to continue the story.
Ensure that there are at least five rooms where the player can go to read and complete the story.
The transition between rooms should be strictly through camera translational movement.
Camera transitions between rooms using Unity's Transform.Translate() or tweening tools like DOTweenLinks to an external site./iTweenLinks to an external site..
When the player clicks on Next to go to the next room or Previous to go to the last room, the camera should translate/transition/animate to that room; the player should not just find themselves in it.
